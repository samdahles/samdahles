Ethical hacker with a focus on forensics and offensive cybersecurity tooling, particularly around enumeration and understanding how systems expose themselves under real conditions. Alongside that, I spend a lot of time building random software projects, usually because something seemed interesting or useful enough to explore.

Some repositories are active, others are stable and unchanged. Not everything is meant to be polished or complete. In many cases, the code exists simply because it needed to exist.

I am interested in cryptography as it appears in real software, where design decisions, constraints, and failure modes matter more than theory alone.

*Most of these projects are POCs I developed to get to know a subject better or to test myself.*
